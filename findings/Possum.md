## Possum Portals

November 2023 (Hats Finance)

Deposit funds to receive their yield upfront. Deployed on Arbitrum.

### High: Users can bypass `portalEnergy` calculations when unstaking to steal extra yield from the contract

An attacker is able to inflate their `portalEnergy` infinitely by exploiting the rounding error on L314 of `Portal.sol` â€” since the division will round down, any `_amount` small enough to make `_amount * maxLockDuration` less than `SECONDS_PER_YEAR` will return `0`. Any logic that uses the raw `_amount` proceeds as intended, so the attacker still receives their unstaked funds like they normally would. But they also keep all the `portalEnergy` they built up in the process.

**Proof of concept**

[https://gist.github.com/ethanbennett/0b2c8e85089b89588eeebfc602cf0763](https://gist.github.com/ethanbennett/0b2c8e85089b89588eeebfc602cf0763)

It is possible that this could be exploited more efficiently or with greater impact than the loop in the PoC, but this attack is already significant enough to consider it high-risk: `portalEnergy` has real value within `Portal`, and that value can be stolen without limit by any attacker.

**Recommendation**

The simplest solution would likely be instituting a minimum for the `_amount` of principal tokens in both `stake` and `unstake`. Note that this minimum is a function of the `maxLockDuration`: it should not be referenced explicitly, since it will change with `maxLockDuration` (which, itself, is designed to change). As is, the minimum number of principal tokens with which the contract operates properly is `5`.

You could check for this dynamically with:

`require (_amount * maxLockDuration >= SECONDS_PER_YEAR)`

The reason I suggest this over adjusting the math is that rounding up instead of down could present a different risk in this context. However, if it is important to retain this functionality for small `_amount`s, the math could be reworked instead.
